Hello,

In this article , we are going to make stopwatch using Raspberry Pi Pico and tm1637 4 digit 7 segment display module.

Here, I used tm1637 4 digit 7 segment display module as a display to show real-time counting.

Letâ€™s make this.

If you are new to Raspberry Pi Pico and wants to get started then click here, it is all about getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico.

# Required Components

> Raspberry Pi Pico

> Breadboard

> Jumper Wires

> 2 Push buttons

> 1K Ohm resistor

# Schematic Diagram

Follow this schematic diagram and make connections.

> Connect CLK pin of tm1637 with GP1 pin of pico.

> Connect DIO pin of tm1637 with GP0 pin of pico.

> Connect ground pin of tm1637 with ground pin of pico.

> Connect Vcc ground pi of tm1637 with Vbus pin of pico that is 5volt pin

> Connect push button as shown in figure.

There are two push buttons, One is for start counting and another is to reset pico.



# Coding

To write and upload program here i used Thonny IDE. You can download from here.

Here i write code in micropython.

`````
from machine import Pin
import time
import tm1637

tm = tm1637.TM1637(clk=Pin(1), dio=Pin(0))
Button = Pin(2, Pin.IN)

a = 0
b = 0

tm.numbers(a,b)

while True:
    if Button.value() == 1:
        while True:
            tm.numbers(a,b)
            b = b+1
            if b > 59:
                b = 0
                a = a+1
            time.sleep(1)
            
            
``````

Save this code in Raspberry Pi Pico and and name it main.py
